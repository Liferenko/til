# no-bullshit interview process

This way it is kinda non-traditional, but it definitely shows the skills: review skill, analalysing, task decomposing, deep-in-details skill

Some of the things you can expect from the skills interview are:

- Review a pull request - Let’s pair on a real pull request in the system and have you work through understanding what it does. Here we’re looking for the kinds of questions that you might ask and how you apply your experience and knowledge from previous roles.

- Pair on a feature - We’ll pick an easy feature from the codebase and work together to implement it. Similar to the pull request review, we’re looking to see how you approach a problem.

- Bring in some code - Rather than working on our code, let’s work on yours instead. Bring in something you’re proud of building (and can show us!) and let’s work through how you might add a feature to your own code base.

- Tell us about our code - Let's bring up some of our code and you tell us what it's doing and ask some questions about why we did it.

- In all cases, these aren’t pass or fail tests in the sense that you must add the feature in the hour we have allotted. Instead, we’re looking for how you approach a problem and communicate with the engineer that’s running the test.
