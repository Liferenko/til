## Why use lock_version?

Levels of locking:
- table-level
- row-level
- page-level
- deadlock


ELI5 explanation from AI:
- Lock versions are like taking turns drawing, so you don't accidentally draw over each otherâ€™s pictures. When your friend is drawing, you wait, and when they are done, it's your turn.
- Explicit locking is like agreeing to use specific colored pencils only one at a time. If you're using the red pencil, your friend waits until you finish before they start using it.
