## Ecto.Changeset vs. Application Services + Event Sourcing


I hope this TIL will be finished some day. Because for now I'm not sure I got the idea why when we need to add one more field in a schema + one method - we need to create add_this_shiny_new_field_application_service.ex + *_test.exs + *event_for_event_sourcing.ex + **_test.exs

I can't catch the idea of this approach. I hope I will get it soon and summarize it here.
