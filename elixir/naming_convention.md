### Conter-intuitive (from my POV) but make-sense naming

> "While normally I would also chose to stick to simpler name, like module.verb, the Phoenix conventions are using the noun for resource in the function names. In this particular module it is not a big deal, but generally we should stick to those conventions. Eg.: User.create_user, User.update_user, User.delete_user. Sometimes there might be different resources behind a single context module and a generic update would not work there."(c) an anonimous teamlead
