## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

"the dullest pencil is better than the sharpest memory"(c) translated quote

Why to use ADR? for future-you. When a decision has been sealed, what was the context, who was a participant of the decision.
it's better for newcomers, it's better for future-you, it's better for logging your job process. I'd say it's even better for your retrospective meeting in short scope because you'll remember what you did during past sprint :)
