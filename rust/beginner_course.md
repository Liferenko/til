# Rust for TS developers 

0) Rust koans - nice way to kickstart (for those who knows basic concepts in programming languages)

1) A course "Rust for TS developers" is done. The course is good, useful, quite "dry" and cover 2 main concepts: trait+imp+generics and Borrow checker.
I think it's quite good for starting up.

2) `rustup docs --book` - offline Rust book
