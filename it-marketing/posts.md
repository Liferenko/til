- Milestones
it gives your product amazing results when you're trying to set milestones.
Everything starts from them.
You're solving a maze (a labyrinth) end-to-beginning


Example: we ended up on yet another one VC's application form. They asked us about milestones for next 12-18 months. 
It took around 1.5 hour: make a word-mess, clean it up, suggest key numbers and values, clean it up again, suggest timeframes, test it for "Ha-ha", clean it up OMT and add it into the form.


- "Fill_The_Form"-driven-company.
The company's journey is way more transparent when it's clean for everybody what we do, how we do, why we do it.
It is amazingly hard to bring it out from founder's head as-is. 
It is surprisingly easier to do it as a fill-the-form way.
