## DDD. Integration patterns

> "...all integration patterns between bounded contexts: https://opus.ch/ddd-concepts-and-patterns-context-map/. You almost never want to be a conformist if not both services are in your direct control. Add anticorruption layer to be safe..."(c)

### DDD Integration patterns
- Customer/Supplier
- Shared Kernel
- Open Host Service
- Published Language
- Anticorruption Layer
- Conformist
- Separate Ways

Most interesting for now is:
Anticorruption Layer
If we have no control over the context we would like to connect to, and its model doesnâ€™t fit ourselves an anticorruption layer should be considered. This layer communicates with the other context in its language and translates from and to it.

The anticorruption layer can be especially useful when migrating a legacy system. It encapsulates the legacy system, and our new shiny solution communicates only with this layer in a clean language.

Level of communication and commitment: Low
Level of control over the involved systems: Low
