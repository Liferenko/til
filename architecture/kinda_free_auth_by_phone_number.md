## Validate your phone number with a code. And it's free (for a business)

Vietnam, an app Zalo (a messanger + payment app)

For local phone numbers they provide a phone call validation. 
But what about international phone numbers? 
They throw a ball on your side: you need to send a SMS with their generated token to the provided phone number. If they receieve it, they will validate your phone number.

Kinda smart and fresh solution :)
