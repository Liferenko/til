## How to define the user story written in a good way

### The epic
- our epics are always connected to a atlassian discovery idea
- epics are broken down into User Stories
- epics are timeboxed with rough estimations
- epics are owned by PM or Heaf of Dev

### User story
- is a conversation starter
- captures a single user need or goal
- deliver a small, valuable piece of functionality
- has one owner from a team
- is not a fixed definition of development work. It has to be refined with the dev team

User story has to be I.N.V.E.S.T:
independent
negotiable
valueable
estimable
small
testable


### Sub-task
- breaks down a user story into actionable step
- describes how we complete the user story not What will complete the user story
- breaks down complexity
- increases clarity
- tracks dev progress

#### Use sub-tasks when:
- the story requires several tech steps
- different team members can/will handle separate parts
- the story needs distinct actions that follow a sequence

#### Don't use sub-tasks when:
- the story is already small and straightforward
- planning admin or non-tech work
- the task can exist on its own and does not depend on the user story
- the sub-task just repeats the story
