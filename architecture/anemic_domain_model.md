## Anemic domain model

Anemic domain model is a term used to describe a domain model where the domain objects are simple data containers with no behavior. The behavior is implemented in services that operate on the domain objects. This is in contrast to a rich domain model where the domain objects contain both data and behavior.

| The basic symptom of an Anemic Domain Model is that at first blush it looks like the real thing.
