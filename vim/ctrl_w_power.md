# Ctrl+w + [something]

I've been using <C-w> daily but I didn't know it is that powerful. 
Usual movement for me:
<C-w> w - select next pane
<C-w> 39> - increase current pane's size for 39 pixels on a right border
<C-w> | (shigt+\) - Maximize current pane


BUT! 

I wa today years old when I found <C-w> T (move current pane as a new separated tab)
Damn, it's awesome. Usually I did the same with :Texplore -> <C-p> -> find my file -> open it
