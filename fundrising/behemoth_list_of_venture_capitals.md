### Behemoth-size list of venture capitals with useful details


**Need to mention: the link leads to some kind of marketing tool which I'm not related to and have no benefits from it**

It is kind of nice and sharp "marketing magnet", which, I bet, works simple yet powerful for its creators.

During this list's surfing I ended up with a thought "How to send them our pitch deck without been banned by email providers". And at this exact moment I noticed a tiny-tiny button "Message all" above the list. Well played, guys. Fair game. No doubt there are many business owners who will be your lead in a sales funnel. 

I like when it works like that: they gave huge potentially profitable payload and ask for big buck. That is fair deal.
